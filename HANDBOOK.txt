	Greetings, new test subject!

Welcome to: The Experimental Testing "Risk-free" Arena (TETRA™)!
You may be confused, scared and quite possibly having a panic attack right now,
having woken up in a locked, windowless room, with no memory of what happened prior... 
But don't worry about that-
Because it is going to get a lot worse!
(Aren't you excited?)

This handbook is intended to brief you on anything and everything you need to know before entering TETRA™.
I mean... no one is forcing you to read this (unlike how we are forcing you in the arena).
You could just skip over it, and probably do fine anyway.
Though, it will probably still give you better odds of actually surviving.
Previous studies have concluded that people who read the handbook are -6% more likely to make it to the end.
Wait- did I read that right? Negative? This isn't a typo right?
*muffled background conversation*
Well- then.
You are actually, statistically speaking, more likely to die reading this...
Uhh...
Read at your own risk then, I guess.
Frankly, I get paid either way.

********************************INDEX********************************
> GOALS You Will Probably Die Trying to Achieve
> Your Body and YOURSELF
> "Certified-Safe" TERRAIN
> ENCOUNTERS You Will Die From
> EVENTS You Will Also Die From
> ITEMS People Will Use to Kill You
> CRAFTING People Will Use to Make Items to Kill You
********************************GOALS********************************
Your primary goal is to-
Well...
Not die.
...While everyone else does.
This can be achieved in any number of ways.
Just don't die and you will be fine, and even win too.

Your secondary goal is to reach the tower in the center of the arena.
Now why is there a medieval styled stone tower?
Because it's freaking awesome that's why!

At the top of it is our Multi-use Automatic Genuine Idol of Killing (MAGIK™)
Basically, get it before someone else does.
Or maybe kill the guy who took it.
You don't NEED to get this per say, but getting it will be a huge advantage.
It boosts all of your skill tasks by 4, pretty sweet honestly.

********************************YOURSELF********************************
Everyone has three natural stats:

Physical (Phy)	How fast you run, how hard you hit, etc. Basically- your athletic ability.
Mental	 (Men)  How intelligent. This helps with crafting.
Social	 (Soc)  How likeable you are. This is used to "charm" people, forcings others to give you things, or simply not kill you.

These are your god-gifted abilities and will determine how you play, at least, in the beginning.
Find a strategy that works taking into account your stats, and you should be fine.
Don't fret if you are low in one stat however, you can permeneantly[SPELL] increase them with Quik-Stab™ Drugs.

Everyone also has three item stats:

Attack  (Atk)   Extra bonus when attacking.
Craft   (Cft)   Extra bonus when crafting.
Charm   (Crm)   Extra bonus when charming.

These are granted by tools you have, such as swords, saws, etc.
They are not permenant[SPELL], and are lost as soon as the tool is lost.

********************************TERRAIN********************************
There are many terrain types in TETRA™, some are brutal and try to kill you, others don't.
All terrain areas are "Certified-Safe" by the National Ratings Agency. Probably.

> Spawn
This is where players spawn, and contain a lot of loot. Pretty crazy when the game starts.
Stay here, or don't. Your choice.

> Plains
Your starting biome. Very peaceful and open area. The temperature is nice, and the sun is shining.
Don't get distracted, someone will still brutally beat you into a pulp here.

> Forest
A densely packed temperate forest. Good for gathering materials and food.

> River
There is a good chance you will drown attempting to cross this. Like- don't try it. You can and will die.
A raft might help, but you would have to be not completely stupid to make one of those.
By the way, the river is salt water, just to annoy people dying of thirst.

> Bridge
There are four bridges in TETRA™. They are used to cross the River safely.
Because of their location, scarcity, and ability to ease river crossing, it is a reliable place to expect players to be.
Ambush them here, cut the bridge dropping others into the sea, do whatever you want.

> Desert
It's hot. Very hot. Like "You-didn't-even-know-humans-could-survive-triple-digit-temperatures" kind of hot. 
There is little water and food. Yeah- it is not fun.
You better be prepared to cross this, and not stay too long.
That is, if a sandstorm doesn't kick up causing you to lose your way.

> Crag
It's cold. Very cold. I think you get the point this time.
It's somehow even drier than the desert, and seems to be entirely void of life.
Huge pitch black rocks jut out of the dark stone ground. Legend has it in ancient times a huge meteor exploded above here.
Not really, our design team thought that would be freaking awesome though.

> TETRA™ Tower
The MAGIK™ lies at the top, casting rays of heavanly light to the area round it.
Get it and kill some people!
This is also the center of the map. A lot of epic battles will probably be here, and we've placed cameras in preperation.
Don't dissapoint us.

> Shadow Zone
Consider this "motivation" to "mingle" with your "friends".
It forms outside the area, and will slowly engluf the map closing in on the center, forcing you inside.
We don't recommend standing in it. Although, you are free to try, we haven't actually tested it on humans yet.

********************************ENCOUNTERS********************************
Sorry introverts, you are going to have to actually meet people here.
Sometimes you will encounter one or more players.
Luckily they are only trying to kill you, significantly easier than a conversation.


Assuming you see someone, you have three options:

>Attack
Engage the oponent like a manly man! Scream fearlessly as you charge right into your impending doom!

>Run
Flee like the coward you've always been.

>Charm
Attempt to charm the enemy into either not killing you or giving you free stuff as well.

There are a few situations that will arrive depending on the choices of both parties.


>Duel  		(Attack & Attack)
An honorable fight to the death.
Lethal on loss on either side.

>Chase 		(Run & Attack)
A hunt! Chase that coward down and slaughter him! Lethal on loss for Runner.

>Flee  		(Run & Run)
Nothing happens. You are both cowards.

>Charm 		(Charm & Run)
"Stop running! Please! I just want you to give me your stuff!" On loss runner losses items.

>Charm or Die 	(Charm & Attack)
"Please don't kill me. I'm to young to die!" Lethal on loss for Charmer.

>Charm Off 	(Charm & Charm)
"Give me your items." "No give me your items!" Loser on either side gives up items.

On a lethal loss, you are given a 50% chance of dying. If you survive, you lose ALL of your items and ALL of your stats decrease permanetly. 

********************************EVENTS********************************
Stuff happens. It isn't fun. Have fun not having fun.

> River Swimming
You attempt to cross a river (Physical) or face lethal drowning.

> Food Shortage
Make a starvation check, or face lethal consequences. You should have packed an extra granola bar.

> Water Shortage
Make a thirst check, or face lethal consequences.

> Misplaced Item
You misplace an item. It's gone. Forever. Stop being so disorganized.

> Deus Ex Meteor
A meteors falls out of the sky and kills you. I'm not joking. You're dead.

On lethal failure, you are given a % chance of dying based on how high the score you failed with is.
If you survive, that score goes down permanetly.

********************************ITEMS********************************
Supply crates are hidden throughout the map, randomly. They contain a wealth of useful items. Or not.
There are a few types of items.


> DRUGS aren't bad Mmmkay?
Drugs are packaged in a nice, convenient, and (probably) sterile Quik-Stab™ injection syringe.

Instructions are as follows:
Remove safety cap on your Quik-Stab™ injection syringe.
Make sure flesh depth arms deploy on your Quik-Stab™ injection syringe.
Quickly stab your Quik-Stab™ injection syringe into leg.

Drugs come in three flavors:
Lemon-Lime  (Phyiscal)
Fresh Mint  (Mental)
Fruit Punch (Social)

You might (will) feel a burning sensation as your new power coarses through your veins.
Each drug permenantly increases your respective natural stat.

Now you might think there aught be be a catch, and be concerned about some side affects.
We are happy to announce there are absolutely ZERO* side affects. Pretty much magic. But not MAGIK™

*Or at least any side affects you will notice during the duration of the test.


> TOOLS
Tools are bonuses to specific situation stats.
A sword might give you a bonus to combat, but not to your entire physical stat.
Then are less permanent than drugs, and can be "voluntarily" given away to another play.

There are three types, and three tiers of items.

Item types:
       Weapons- Boosts attack ability.
Crafting Tools- Boosts crafting ability.
   Charm Items- Boosts charming ability.

Item Tiers:
      Crude- Low level boost, usually hand crafted with poor resources.
     Decent- Mid level boost, mass produced common items you would find in day to day life.
Masterpiece- High level boost, created by a skilled crafter, it would be worth a bit in the real world.
 
********************************CRAFTING********************************
If you are a smart fellow, and are lacking in some... other areas, you might be able to craft something to help with that.

To craft, hold two items you want to use.
Each material has a tier value, low medium or high. These are averaged and rounded down, giving your material value.
You may now enter the crafting menu, and must select the type of tool you want to make (atk,cft,crm), and the tier.
You may choose any tier, however it will be more difficult to craft a high tier tool with a low material tier.
This of course works the other way too, if will be easier to craft a low tier item with a high material value
Assuming you are an average fellow with no item bonuses, and the material tier is equal to what you want to make, you should have a 50/50 chance of success.
